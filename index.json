Ungoliant version: v1.1.0 : Document oriented pipeline, multilingual subcorpus, annotations Changes The corpus is not backward compatible, as the metadata and textual content have been merged into JSON objects. Document-oriented: Identifications are done per document, based on the proportion of content in a single language. Annotations: Annotations are labels you can filter on, potentially enabling better quality control (sacrificing corpus size). Per-line identification: Metadata hold line-level identification/confidence. Multilingual subcorpus: A new, 12GB multilingual subcorpus containing documents with sentences in different languages in significant proportion. Removed languages: Bavarian, Chavacano, Northern Frisian, Manx, Haitian Creole, Interlingue, Northern Luri, Mirandese, Eryza, Neapolitan, Pampanga, Romansh, Rusyn, Scots, Tuvinian, Venetian, West Flemish. No deduplicated corpus: Since the subcorpora are document oriented, doing a subcorpus-wide deduplication would break documents‚Äô integrity. We may consult the community and provide tools for deduplication later on. Data layout The corpus is now distributed in JSONLines format, which means that each line represents a single document, encoded in a JSON object.\nA text extraction utility is being added in the oscar-tools binary, enabling the creation of plain-text datasets from JSONL subcorpora.\n{ \u0026#34;content\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;newline\\nseparaaaaaaaaaaated\\ncontent\u0026#34;, //content itself // Headers from the crawler // Note that nothing is changed, so the content length may be incorrect. \u0026#34;warc_headers\u0026#34;:{ \u0026#34;warc-refers-to\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026lt;urn:uuid:83f2e1d4-5ed3-41db-86ff-f7826c4c20f9\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;warc-date\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;2021-09-16T11:07:14Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;warc-block-digest\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;sha1:X3OWP47FG2O5LBNMFSNB44FJF2SSRC26\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;warc-type\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;conversion\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;warc-identified-content-language\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;eng\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;content-length\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;1694\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;warc-target-uri\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://foo.bar\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;warc-record-id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026lt;urn:uuid:3304bc27-17d0-4ffd-a692-340381478a5f\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;content-type\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;text/plain\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;metadata\u0026#34;:{ // Document-wide identification. // The \u0026#34;prob\u0026#34; is the weighted average of the identified lines. \u0026#34;identification\u0026#34;:{ \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;prob\u0026#34;:0.6268374 }, // Annotations.

This annotation uses a blocklist and labels a tiny part of the corpus: It does not catch most of the adult content. More information about the thresholds and annotators are present in our paper.\nAbout the absence of some low-resource languages A number of low resource languages have disappeared or shrunk dramatically. This is due to the new document-level language identification, which may shadow low-resource languages that exhibit a linguistic proximity with higher-resourced ones.\nAs an example, Swiss German went from 5MB (21.09) to 360KB (22.01), but we found that the German (500GB) subcorpus contained around 30MB of Swiss German (without filtering out the ‚Ä¶","date":1641042131,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674126237,"objectID":"9870eb920afa90636d61014f19304278","permalink":"https://oscar-project.org/post/oscar-v22-01/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T15:02:11+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/oscar-v22-01/","section":"post","summary":"The January, 2022 version of the OSCAR Corpus.","tags":[],"title":"OSCAR 22.01","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Table of Contents How can I get the original files using the HuggingFace datasets platform?

HuggingFace‚Äôs datasets library internally uses Apache arrow files, different from the txt.gz/jsonl.gz pair that we use. These .arrow files can usually be found in ~/.cache/huggingface/datasets/ subfolders.\nHowever, it is possible to get the original (txt.gz/jsonl.gz) files using Git LFS.\nThe following steps assume you have git and git-lfs installed, and are on a UNIX system.

OSCAR is distributed in split files that are compressed in order to save spave. However, some decompression programs have trouble dealing with gz files.

Each line has an offset and an nb_sentences field that can be used to get related lines in text files.\nNew corpus OSCAR 21.09 is the latest release of the OSCAR Corpus. The first to be generated by Ungoliant, and also the first containing metadata.\nNote that the data used to generate the corpus is from February 2021, but the next releases of OSCAR Corpus will try to narrow the gap between source data and corpus release.\nAnother important information is that there is no shuffled version anymore.\nIt is expected to be available during September 2021 via manual application through the Contact form of the website, and later on other platforms.\n","date":1630590355,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644600590,"objectID":"b14b90cb26f7528504366223e6832672","permalink":"https://oscar-project.org/post/news-21-09/","publishdate":"2021-09-02T15:45:55+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/news-21-09/","section":"post","summary":"New tools, metadata, and a fresh corpus.","tags":[],"title":"OSCAR News: September 2021","type":"post"},{"authors":["Julien Abadji","Pedro Ortiz Suarez"],"categories":["corpus","update"],"content":" If you want to get the new corpus please send us a mail using the mail in our homepage, with ‚ÄúOSCAR Access Request‚Äù as mail title.

We then compare the performance of OSCAR-based and Wikipedia-based ELMo embeddings for these languages on the part-of-speech tagging and parsing tasks. We show that, despite the noise in the Common-Crawl-based OSCAR data, embeddings trained on OSCAR perform much better than monolingual embeddings trained on Wikipedia. They actually equal or improve the current state of the art in tagging and parsing for all five languages. In particular, they also improve over multilingual Wikipedia-based contextual embeddings (multilingual BERT), which almost always constitutes the previous state of the art, thereby showing that the benefit of a larger, more diverse corpus surpasses the cross-lingual benefit of multilingual embedding architectures.\u0026#34;, } The Unshuffled OSCAR If you need a copy of any of the unshuffled sub-corpora, please contact us using the contact form down below. Please include your name, affiliation, contact details, which languages do you need and a brief description of how you intend to use OSCAR. We will evaluate your request and answer accordingly.\nThe unshuffled OSCAR is now available in HuggingFace‚Äôs datasets library They have obtained our permission to redistribute the unshuffled OSCAR and they allow users to download a corpus all at once as opposed to file by file. You can get more information about how to download OSCAR using their library by visiting OSCAR‚Äôs dataset card.\nDownloading OSCAR All the data is distributed by language, both the original and the deduplicated versions of the data are available. To download a file just click the desired link on the table below. Languages are split in shards of around 700MB, these shards are standalone. A plain text file with checksums is also provided.\nThe OSCAR corpus is yet to be filtered, so please be careful when using it, specially for text generation tasks! To see which sub-corpora have been audited, please refer to the list of publications above for more information.\nYou‚Äôll be asked to create an HumanID account in order to download a corpus. This is intended, and we do it in order to limit traffic and reduce abuse of the infrastructure. The OSCAR corpus is hosted by Huma-Num, you can read more about them on their website.\nAll sizes are for the uncompressed files.\nLanguage Words original Size original File original Words deduplicated Size deduplicated File deduplicated Afrikaans 43,482,801 241M af 29,533,437 163M af Albanian 374,196,110 2.3G sq 186,856,699 1.2G sq Alemannic 841,750 5.0M als 459,001 2.8M als Amharic 28,301,601 360M am 16,086,628 206M am Arabic 8,117,162,828 82G ar 3,171,221,354 32G ar Aragonese 52,896 1.3M an 45,669 801K an Armenian 273,919,388 3.7G hy 110,196,043 1.5G hy Assamese 6,956,663 113M as 4,366,570 71M as Asturian 381,005 2.4M ast 325,237 2.0M ast Avaric 24,720 409K av 19,478 324K av Azerbaijani 322,641,710 2.8G az 167,742,296 1.5G az Bashkir 9,796,764 128M ba 6,922,589 90M ba Basque 120,456,652 848M eu 45,359,710 342M eu Bavarian 399 503 bar 399 503 bar Belarusian 144,579,630 1.8G be 83,499,037 1.1G be Bengali 623,575,733 11G bn 363,766,143 5.8G bn Bihari 8,848 110K bh ‚Ä¶","date":1630584460,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1645032036,"objectID":"1562a830fa4b3cacce5c9f97d421126c","permalink":"https://oscar-project.org/post/oscar-2019/","publishdate":"2021-09-02T14:07:40+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/oscar-2019/","section":"post","summary":"The first OSCAR Corpus version from 2019.","tags":[],"title":"OSCAR 2019","type":"post"},{"authors":["Julien Abadji","Pedro Ortiz Suarez","Laurent Romary","Beno√Æt Sagot"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1626998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630676828,"objectID":"6d8be031bf26602ae3c68247d44cc66b","permalink":"https://oscar-project.org/publication/2021/cmlc9/ungoliant/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021/cmlc9/ungoliant/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a new pipeline that is faster, modular, parameterizable, and well documented.
